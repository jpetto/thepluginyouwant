# The Plugin You Want
## The best* plugins for web development.

You know that thing that happens every 7 months where you need a tooltip or
modal plugin and you go to Google and have to wade through tons of outdated
junk? That sucks. Wouldn't it be better to have a curated, updated list to
check before you venture out into the unwashed masses of search results?

Of course, all plugins have their drawbacks/limitations. This list is
meant to be what you *probably* want.

Each category should have a maximum of two options. The idea here is to
grab and go without being presented with too many options. Google is always
there if you need something different.

Contributions are critical. I doubt it's anyone's job to stay up to date on
every latest plugin. Found something new/better? Help the next developer.
