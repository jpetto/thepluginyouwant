# The Plugin You Want
## The best* plugins for web development.

Of course, everything has its drawbacks/limitations. This list is meant to be what you *probably* want.

Each category should have a maximum of two options. You know how to google if you need something different.

Suggestions are critical. I doubt it's anyone's job to stay up to date on every latest plugin. Found something new/better? Help the next developer. Make a pull request.
